 2) All Blog Page: This page will display all the blogs available in your database.
 3) Add Tourist Spot Page: This page will allow users to add new blogs.
 4) Wishlist: A private/protected route where users can see the blogs they've added to the database.
 5) Update/Delete: Functionality to update or delete a blog, typically accessible from the My List page.

 6) User Registration:  Simple form for users to input basic details (name, email, password). Ensure entered information meets required criteria (valid email format, strong password).
